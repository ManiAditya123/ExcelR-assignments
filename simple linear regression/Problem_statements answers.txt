1) Delivery_time -> Predict delivery time using sorting time 
answer:- 
2) Salary_hike -> Build a prediction model for Salary_hike
answer:- 

------------------------------------------------------------

Build a simple linear regression model by performing EDA and do necessary transformations and select the best model using R or Python.


SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL ANSWERS:-

Simple Linear Regression
* y= b0 + b1 X
* b0,b1 are ==> Features or Parameters
* X==> Dependent Variable
* Y==> Independent Variable
* Loss Function  Or Optimisation Function==> Ordinary Least  Squares

 PREDICTION MODEL FOR DELIVERY TIME:-

* There are  NO MISSING VALUES,NO NAN VALUES ,NO OUTLIERS in the dataset and There are very low number of records.
* The Correlation between the dependent and independent variables are(r= 0.82) which means moderatly Correlated.
* calculated  the Predicted values and Errors
* Mean Squared Error and R^2  values are: [r^2 = 0.68] [mse =7.79 ]

 PREDICTION MODEL FOR SALARY HIKE:-

* There are  NO MISSING VALUES,NO NAN VALUES ,NO OUTLIERS in the dataset and There are very low number of records.
* The Correlation between the dependent and independent variables are(r= 0.92) which means Perfectly  Correlated.
* calculated  the Predicted values and Errors.
* Mean Squared Error and R^2  values are:[r^2 = 0.95] [mse =6502000509.014902 ]
